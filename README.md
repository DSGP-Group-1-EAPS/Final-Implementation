# Final-Implementation

## Project Overview
This project aims to implement a machine learning model using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend. The primary objective is to create a web application that leverages the model for various functionalities.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for developing the backend services.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python used to build the backend APIs.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for the frontend.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.

## Directory Structure
- `mui/react-app`: Contains the React application setup using Vite with minimal configuration for HMR and ESLint rules.
